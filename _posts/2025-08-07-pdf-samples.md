This article includes links to two PDF files. 
- [Patient Screening conceptual topic for an administrator tool](/assets/Patient Screening Category Manager.pdf)
  - The source content for this sample was written in MadCap Flare for an HTML5 output. The PDF was printed from my browser because Patient Screening did not have a PDF output.
- [Sunrise Financial Manager Feature Guide](/assets/Feature Guide-Episode Snapshot Financial Reporting Tables_Redacted.pdf)
  - The source content for this sample was written in Oxygen XML using the DITA structure. The PDF was published from IXIASOFT CCMS with an official output. Redaction was added later so the sample could be used in my portfolio.
